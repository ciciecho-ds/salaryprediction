# Salary Prediction Project: What leads to a higher salary?
This project uses data on employees' education background, work experience and details about their jobs such as industries, locations and job titles to create predictions on salaries of the test data.

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The goal of this project is to predict salaries based on certain criteria such as education background, location relative to metropolises and years of work experience, etc.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Exploratory data analysis 
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter notebook

## Project Description
The data for this project is provided by datasciencedreamjob.com.
In this project, linear regression and random forest regression are used and the best model is selected based on the average MSE.

Findings from EDA: 
* There is a positive relationship between job type and salary.
* Education and service industries pay the least; auto, health and web are in the middle; finance and oil industries tend to pay the highest salaries. 
* Engineering and business majors have the highest salaries. 
* Having an advanced degree leads to higher pay. Having a Bachelor's degree makes the biggest difference.
* Years of experience has a positive relationship with salary and miles from metropolis has a negative relationship with salary.
